## Motivation to Read

Currently also reading the book Head First - Design Patterns. This books assumes prior knowledge about object-oriented programming (OOP), and recommends reading a book about this topic.

Looked around for books OOP and decided to go for the book Deciphering Object-Oriented Programming wih C++ based on:

- Good reviews of the book at Amazon
- Being a newer book, at the time of writing
- Had credits at Packt to get a pdf of the book for free
- Teaches C++, a topic that I want to learn more about
- Book includes exercises, important for solidifying learning
